IPBAND (FEB 20, 2002)
==========================


Contents
========
ipband is a pcap based IP traffic monitor. It listens on a
network interface in promiscuous mode, tallies per-subnet
traffic and bandwidth usage and starts detailed logging when
specified threshold for the specific subnet is exceeded.


Suggested Usage
===============
The utility could be handy in a limited  bandwidth WAN
environment  to pinpoint offending traffic sources if certain links become saturated
to the point where legitimate traffic starts getting dropped.

It also can be used to monitor internet connection when
specifying the range of local IP addresses.

Installing
==========
(1) You must first have pcap library installed (see Requirements below).
(2) Type 'make' to produce executables.
(3) Type 'make install' to install executable, man page and sample config file.
(4) 'ipband' typically must be run as root to read the network interface.


Documentation
=============
See the man page ipband.1.
