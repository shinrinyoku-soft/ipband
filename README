IPBAND (FEB 20, 2002)
==========================


Contents
========
ipband is a pcap based IP traffic monitor. It listens to a
network interface in promiscuous mode, tallies per-subnet
traffic and bandwidth usage and starts detailed logging if
specified threshold for the specific subnet is exceeded.


Suggested Usage
===============
The utility could be handy in a limited  bandwidth  WAN
environment  (frame relay, ISDN etc. circuits) to pinpoint
offending traffic source if certain links become saturated
to the	point where legitimate packets start getting dropped.

It also can be used to monitor internet connection when
specifying the range of local ip addresses (to avoid firing reports
about non-local networks).


Installing
==========
(1) You must first have pcap library installed (see Requirements below).
(2) Type 'make' to produce executables.
(3) Type 'make install' to install executable, man page and sample config file.
(4) 'ipband' typically must be run as root to read the network interface.


Documentation
=============
See the man page ipband.1.


Bugs/Todo
=========
Report mailing blocks until pipe to sendmail returns. Might add threads later.

by default in some Unix environments, and it available
