ipband 0.8.1	13 Jun 2008

   Debian Bug report - #363407. Changed integer type to hold cumulative byte count from 
   long to double to avoid counter overflow in reports.

   Debian specific (Thanks to Giuseppe Iuculano):
   No /usr/local/, man 8, no printf when runs in background, 
   don't fail to build if strtok_r is defined as a macro and change default MTA command 
   string for mailing reports.

ipband 0.8	02 Oct 2006

   A seg fault issue is resolved when a non tcp/udp protocol is encountered during
   report generation. Thanks to Shane Denovan for providing the patch. 

   Installation directories in Makefile can be specified using PREFIX, BINDIR, 
   MANDIR, SYSCONFDIR and RCDIR environmental variables. Thanks to Enrico Weigelt.

   Added "-w" option (and corresponding htmlfile and htmltitle directives) to allow
   generation of HTML report. Thanks to SHOREWALL TimeLord for providing the patch.

ipband 0.7.2	25 Mar 2002

   Proper procedure is used to become daemon process.

   Fixed a bug where a footer file descriptor was not closed (sic).

ipband 0.7.1    20 Feb 2002
   Fixed a bug where getopt() return value was interpreted as char and not
   integer. This could have caused problems parsing command line options on
   systems where char is signed by default.

ipband 0.7	10 Jan 2002

   Added "-T" option and "mtastring" directive to specify MTA command
   string. The default is "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -ba" and now can be
   overridden for systems that use other mail transport agents for mailing
   ipband reports.

   As a result, for security reasons call to popen() has been replaced with 
   a safer routine that parses the MTA string and uses exec() to start 
   specified program thus avoiding shell expansions. If ipband is running
   setuid/setgid, these privileges are dropped before exec() in the child process.

   Also added "-J" option and corresponding "lenadj" directive to specify 
   packet length adjustment. This can be used when layer 2 frame sizes for
   the interface ipband is listening on and the interface we are measuring the
   bandwidth for are different.

   A bug in packet length calculation for non-ethernet interfaces has been fixed.
   The bug was in the code inherited from ipaudit and resulted in a hard coded value
   of 14 bytes (ethernet frame size) being added to each IP datagram regardless 
   of the underlying interface. That caused higher bandwidth usage being repoted
   for ppp and raw interfaces.

   Source code is re-organized for easier future development.

   Some minor changes in error handling routines.

ipband 0.6	03 Oct 2001

   Support for PPP and WAN (e.g. Sangoma cards) interfaces is added.

ipband 0.5	26 Sep 2001

   Added "-P" option and "promisc" directive to enable/disable the
   use of promiscuous mode on the network interface. A tiny signed/unsigned
   issue is also fixed in the packed content debug dump code. Thanks to
   Nic Bellamy for providing the patch.

   Also added "-L" option and "localrange" directive to specify a range
   of network numbers that are considered local and therefore packets
   belonging only to these networks are processed. This can be used
   instead of multiple "subnet" directives in the config file.

ipband 0.4.1	13 Sep 2001

   Two bugs related to subnet mask calculation were fixed. One was preventing 
   using zero as a number of mask bits and another one resulted in 32 bits
   being miscalculated as netmask 0.0.0.0.

ipband 0.4	12 Sep 2001

   Option to include threshold exceeded accumulated time and percentage
   in the report is added. This option works only with preloaded subnets
   because otherwise subnet data is deleted when bandwidth usage
   drops below threshold to clear memory and reduce processing time.

ipband 0.31	31 Jul 2001

   Added a couple of include's to compile on FreeBSD

ipband 0.3	12 Jul 2001

   'C' option added to ignore configuration file
   Memory freeing when resetting default settings is now complete

ipband 0.2	11 Jul 2001

   Report mailing option added

ipband 0.1 	04 Jun 2001

   Initial Release
